        <h3>Tips for making miso</h3>
        <p><strong>Add miso paste to stock before serving.</strong>You can cook ingredients in advance but add miso paste to stock before ready to serve</p>
        <p><strong>Never boil miso soup!!!</strong> The miso loses nutrients, flavors, and aromas when you boil it. When you warm it up just before boiling is the perfect temperature for the flavors and aromas of the miso.</p>
        <p><strong>Add other ingredients!!!</strong> You can normally add other ingredients such as green onions, mushroom, daikon, carrots, pork, clams, sea bream, and anything you find tastes good.</p>
        
    <h3>Enjoy!!!</h3>
